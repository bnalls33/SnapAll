Snapall is an Xposed Module for Snapchat, providing Select All Functionality.

Requirements:
   Android v15+
   Xposed Framework 30+
   Snapchat 9.0.1.0

Features:
   If enabled, it allows you to send a snapchat to everyone in your friends list, easily.
   In the action bar there will be a CheckBox that performs a "Select All" function 
     onto your friends and story options. It will also deselect all.

   If it stops working for newer versions of Snapchat please let me know, or help contribute
     by fixing the problem.

   If you DO NOT want "My Story" to be selected automatically, open Xposed
     framework, open "Modules", and tap on "SnapAll". It will open the preferences activity.
