#SnapAll
##Description
Snapall is an Xposed Module for Snapchat, providing Select All Functionality.
This code is VERY MESSY. It was refactored in SnapGroups.


##Requirements:
- Android v15+
- Xposed Framework 30+
- Snapchat 9.5.2.0

##Features:
   If enabled, it allows you to send a snapchat to everyone in your friends list, easily.
   In the action bar there will be a CheckBox that performs a "Select All" function 
     onto your friends and story options. It will also deselect all.

   If you don't want "My Story" to be selected, open Xposed Framework App, open "Modules", and tap on "SnapAll". It will open the preferences activity.
